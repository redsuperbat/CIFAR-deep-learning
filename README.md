# CIFAR-deep-learning

Deep learning algorithm that recognizes pictures by training a model from a huge set of pictures. The code utilizes the keras library which is able to run on top of tensorflow. Keras enables quick and easy testing of recognition models. The model is then tested on testing data and the accuracy is logged. This is a project I did in a AI course during my last year of studies.
