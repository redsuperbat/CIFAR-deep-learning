# CIFAR-deep-learning

Deep learning algorithm that recognizes pictures by training a model from a huge set of pictures. The code utilizes the keras and tensorflow libraries to create the model. The model is then tested on testing data and the accuracy is logged. This is a project I did in a AI course.
